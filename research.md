Initial Research
----------------
The area of PEACH we are working on has a pre-existing repository, and so our initial research involved looking at the existing codebase and reviewing the chosen technology choices in the context of our client's core requirements.

The technology in use was Node.js, however, we were not convinced that it had been written in a clean, scalable way.
