============================
The project website for UCL COMP204P Team 35.

Team Members
------------
- Ben Hadfield
- Julien Nahum
- Sim Zi Jian

Getting Started
---------------
Clone the repo to your computer and then run
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
to start a local server and then navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.

Editing Pages
-------------
To edit a page, open the `.md` file corresponding to that page. So to edit the testing page open `testing.md`.
Files are written using the [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax and the [Liquid Templating Language](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/).
Changes should be automatically detected whilst the Jekyll server is running, but if for some reason this doesn't work then try running
```
$ jekyll build
```
