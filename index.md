## Introduction

This is the project website for UCL COMP204P Team 35. We're working on the Cancer project within the NHS PEACH programme.

The objective of this project is to improve the way that patient's data are processed through the different medical institutions. We are in charge of creating a first version of this focuses on patient with cancer.

#### The Problem

Nowadays, there is a lot of time wasted form the moment a patient is diagnosticated to the moment where the cure actually starts. The process of chosing a type of cure and starting it involves a lot of different people and institutions. The main problem is that all of these institutions have private databases, and can't access data from one to the other.

#### The Solution

Our client, the NHS PEACH Programme, represented by the person of Navin Ramachandran, wants us to build a platform fixing this issue. Indeed, connectiong all the person involved, and giving them access to a common database, would allow the process to go much faster and could potentially save lives.
